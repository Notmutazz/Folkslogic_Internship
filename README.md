# 🚀 FolksLogic Internship Portfolio

This repository contains all the projects, tools, and experiments completed during my internship at **FolksLogic**.  
It showcases hands-on implementations in **Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Optimization, and Automation** — developed with a focus on real-world problem-solving and production-ready practices.

---

## 🧭 Overview

During my internship, I worked on multiple AI and data-driven projects that addressed real business challenges such as sales forecasting, logistics optimization, and resume evaluation automation.  
Each folder in this repository represents a distinct project with its own dataset, codebase, and analysis workflow.
